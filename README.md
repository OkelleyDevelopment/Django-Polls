# Django Polls

## Motivation

Completion of my first project using the Django web framework following the tutorial from the
official documentation.

## Prerequisites

- A virtual environment (I used venv)
- Python 3
- Django >= 3.0

## Program Compilation and Execution

- Activate the virtual environment

## Known Bugs

- None were known at the time of uploading to GitHub

## Future Goals/Project Reflection

Worth the effort and I believe that moving forward, each project will get easier since this
gave a broad overview of the whole development process.
